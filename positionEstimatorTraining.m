% Function positionEstimator has to return the x and y coordinates of the
% monkey's hand position for each trial using only data up to that moment
% in time.
% You are free to use the whole trials for training the classifier.

% To evaluate performance we require from you two functions:

% A training function named "positionEstimatorTraining" which takes as
% input the entire (not subsampled) training data set and which returns a
% structure containing the parameters for the positionEstimator function:
% function modelParameters = positionEstimatorTraining(training_data)
% A predictor named "positionEstimator" which takes as input the data
% starting at 1ms and UP TO the timepoint at which you are asked to
% decode the hand position and the model parameters given by your training
% function:

% function [x y] = postitionEstimator(test_data, modelParameters)
% This function will be called iteratively starting with the neuronal data 
% going from 1 to 320 ms, then up to 340ms, 360ms, etc. until 100ms before 
% the end of trial.


% Place the positionEstimator.m and positionEstimatorTraining.m into a
% folder that is named with your official team name.

% Make sure that the output contains only the x and y coordinates of the
% monkey's hand.


% training function
function [modelParameters] = positionEstimatorTraining(training_data)
  % Arguments:
  
  % - training_data:
  %     training_data(n,k)              (n = trial id,  k = reaching angle)
  %     training_data(n,k).trialId      unique number of the trial
  %     training_data(n,k).spikes(i,t)  (i = neuron id, t = time)
  %     training_data(n,k).handPos(d,t) (d = dimension [1-3], t = time)
  
  % ... train your model
  
  % Return Value:
  
  % - modelParameters:
  %     single structure containing all the learned parameters of your
  %     model and which can be used by the "positionEstimator" function.
  train_size = size(training_data,1);

            f_rate=sum(spikes, 2)/size(spikes,2);
